## Scalable Computation of Molecular Trajectory Analysis Using Apache Spark

This project implements parallel computing techniques learned in CS-5802: Introduction to Parallel Computing to efficiently post-process data generated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The main goal is to process large datasets, reduce computational time, and benchmark the performance improvements against a baseline sequential code.

Project report will be uploaded soon.
